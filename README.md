# Dungeon Friend

Dungeon Friend is an app for simple character sheet management. I built it at my home in Brooklyn during my covid quarantine. If you find bugs or discover any missing data, please open an issue.

Huge thanks is due to [the D&D 5e API](https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-srd-api/) for open sourcing the database.
